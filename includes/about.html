<p>I am a programmer who loves making games and other bits of software.</p>
<p>I started my journey into developing software aged 12, creating a minimalistic web browser with Visual Basic.
Since then, I've created a multitude of games and programs, in an array of different languages, alongside more adventurous projects like my VR glove.</p>
<p>In 2019 I completed a Bachelor's degree in game development, specialising in programming.</p>
